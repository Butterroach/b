# please ignore this repo lmao
(this list is short because i am still trying to find what shenanigans he's doing with the intrnten but btw im combining it with [hagezi/dns-blocklists](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists))

btw how this works is i have a script to run everyday or when he turns on the laptop to auto fetch the bad.txt file and download it and i have yogadns set to block everything in the file its very simpl i only did this so i can update it from my phone or pc
